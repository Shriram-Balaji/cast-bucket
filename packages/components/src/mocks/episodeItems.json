Check out that episode for some background information about the course and how it was released to the public.[/callout]</p>\n<p>We had a wonderful mix of students with varying levels of experience and past certifications. Our focus over the two days was to deep dive the servant leadership aspects of the Scrum Master role by exploring how a Scrum Master serves the Development Team, the Product Owner, and the organization. Empiricism and the Scrum Values were used as guide posts along the way as the situations increased in complexity.</p>\n<p>Our 16 students did an amazing job at not only learning more about the Scrum Master role, but also taught Todd and I quite a lot about co-teaching and facilitation.</p>\n<p>In fact, here are 5 things that really stood out from teaching the Advanced Scrum Master (<strong>PSM II</strong>) course:</p>\n<h2>#1 &#8211; Transparency When Co-Teaching is Essential</h2>\n<p>The night before the class started, Todd and I decided that any discussion about the course or any changes that we wanted to make during the day would be discussed openly and in front of the students. We were not sure how this would work out, but by the end of day one people were really enjoying the level of openness that we displayed when we were not sure what to do next.</p>\n<p>We were at times vulnerable and often used these moments to inject some humor in to the course. Todd and I both noted that by the end of day 2 our running dialogue had become an organic part of the course that helped level set expectations for the students and also helped us more naturally co-facilitate the activities. This was a fun experiment that Todd and I will continue in future courses.</p>\n<h2>#2 &#8211; Liberating Structures Are Amazing</h2>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t using liberating structures in your Scrum practice today, you will be by the end of a PSM II course. Liberating Structures are 33 micro-structures that are easy to use and understand by groups of any size. These structures are created and maintained by <a href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/km/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/km/\">Keith McCandless</a> and <a href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/hl-about/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/hl-about/\">Henri Leipmanowicz</a>. I was amazed by both the simplicity and power of Liberating Structures. Some things that I noticed immediately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every participant was actively engaged during the entire course. Introverts, extroverts and everyone in-between were able to participate, share, and have their voices heard.</li>\n<li>By using Liberating Structures we unlock the wisdom of the crowd and unleash ideas that the entire group can learn from and build upon.</li>\n<li>Sharing is caring and when we care about each other we also tend to trust one another. This high level of trust in the group made complex discussions possible.</li>\n<li>The intelligence of the room was not limited by the trainers. Everyone contributed to the group leveling up their Scrum Master skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Liberating Structures were simple enough for both Todd and I and the students to adopt and learn quickly, while leaving room for discovery and innovation. Ideas, patterns, and insights emerged over time by the students. The participants created the opportunities for their own discoveries within the Liberating Structures. These insights are far more meaningful than anything that I could have read off of a PowerPoint slide.</p>\n<div class=\"video-shortcode\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Amazing what students teach us and each other <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanripley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ryanripley</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/64gIY04ntM\">https://t.co/64gIY04ntM</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Todd Miller (@todd_miller11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/todd_miller11/status/1047939022914564096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are some resources if you want to learn more about Liberating Structures:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.liberatingstructures.com/\">Liberating Structures Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/creating-new-learning-experience-psm-ii-class\">Creating a New Learning Experience with the PSM II Class</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/the-liberators/liberating-structures-unleash-and-involve-everyone-7a15ef57327\">Liberating Structures: Unleash and Involve Everyone</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>#3 &#8211; Students Have a Lot to Teach One Another</h2>\n<p>As it turns out, we can all help each other learn. Day 2 of the PSM II course involves an activity where the students break in to groups and create a 2-minute &#8220;teach back&#8221; where they help the entire class learn about an aspect of being a Scrum Master. Our students took the learning and outcomes from day 1 and combined them with their own experiences to create some really interesting teaching moments for the class. Having the students teach these concepts back to the group turned out to be far more powerful than either of us initially expected.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1353\" style=\"width: 770px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1353\" class=\"wp-image-1353 size-large\" src=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"PSM II Students Teaching Back\" width=\"760\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-35x35.jpg 35w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-82x82.jpg 82w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-400x400.jpg 400w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-600x600.jpg 600w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-760x760.jpg 760w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-768x768.jpg 768w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teachback-Collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1353\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PSM II Students Teaching Back</p></div></p>\n<h2>#4 &#8211; Trainers Must Also Inspect and Adapt</h2>\n<p>The Advanced Scrum Master (PSM II) course is difficult to teach. We are leaving a lot of space for emergence and exploration by using Liberating Structures, Training from the Back of the Room, and Learning 3.0 concepts. This means that as trainers we will have many decision points and options along the way. When Todd and I noticed that the Scrum Values were not well known by this group of students, we spent more time on this topic than planned. But we needed to make this important choice. Empiricism and the Scrum Values are the underpinnings of Scrum. Without them, you get mechanical/zombie/bad scrum.</p>\n<p>This insight and subsequent discussions led us to discover an adaptation to the course flow that we are going to try out in our <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/scrumorg-professional-scrum-master-ii-training-denver-co-oct-17-18-tickets-48794325140\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/scrumorg-professional-scrum-master-ii-training-denver-co-oct-17-18-tickets-48794325140\">upcoming PSM II course in Denver, Colorado</a>. The time invested on the Scrum Values ended up being time very well spent:</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1358\" style=\"width: 770px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1358\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1358\" src=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"PSM II Advanced Scrum Values Ryan Ripley Todd Miller\" width=\"760\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-35x35.jpg 35w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-82x82.jpg 82w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-400x400.jpg 400w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-600x600.jpg 600w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-760x760.jpg 760w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-768x768.jpg 768w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Values-Collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1358\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Student Insights About the Scrum Values &#8211; PSM II</p></div></p>\n<h2>#5 &#8211; Watching a Mindset Shift is Powerful</h2>\n<p>We had a student approach us the morning of day 2 with his notebook open and a wide grin on his face. Our student was excited about an insight about the Sprint Goal and completely revamped the agenda of an upcoming Sprint Planning event.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what he told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I couldn&#8217;t sleep after I got home from day one of the class. I realized that I had to completely change our Sprint Planning agenda. We need a true Sprint Goal that we all understand and can stay aligned with during the Daily Scrum.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We had another student express gratitude for helping her understand what &#8220;done&#8221; really means and the implications of what is both in and out of their definition of done. Another student went home after the end of the class and immediately started work on a Sprint Retrospective format that reinforces the Scrum Values.</p>\n<p>These are some of the concrete changes that we heard about during and after the class. What we also saw during the class was real servant leadership emerge. The students were helping each other by sharing their stories, committing to helping each other going forward, and by showing high amounts of grace, trust, and comfort with people they had just met. This subtle, yet powerful shift in mindset and approach by the students was a joy to watch unfold.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1359\" style=\"width: 770px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1359\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1359\" src=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Scrum Values and Servant Leadership in Action\" width=\"760\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-35x35.jpg 35w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-82x82.jpg 82w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-400x400.jpg 400w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-600x600.jpg 600w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-760x760.jpg 760w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-768x768.jpg 768w, https://ryanripley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Teach-Each-Other-Collage-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1359\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PSM II &#8211; Scrum Values and Servant Leadership in Action</p></div></p>\n<p>The PSM II course is an advanced scrum master journey designed to help practicing Scrum Masters experience a facilitated course.  Empiricism, the scrum values, and servant leadership are at the core of this advanced scrum master course.</p>\n<p>Servant leaders tap in to the collective intelligence of their teams and help people grow, thrive, and prosper.

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MHoafl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here to purchase on Amazon</a>.[/callout]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[reminder]Which topic resonated with you?

Transparency. Responsibility. These are not words that are often applied to software development.</p>\n<p>In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development by integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily development process.</p>\n<p>The first edition of Extreme Programming Explained is a classic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving small-team development, such as having developers write automated tests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly. Much has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second edition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting a program of continuous improvement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2HIZcd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here to purchase on Amazon</a>.[/callout]</p>\n<p>[reminder]Which topic resonated with you?

These specialized tools and techniques are useful for approaching all forms of study, inquiry, and problem solving. Levy applies Metathoughts to a diverse array of issues in contemporary clinical, social, and cross-cultural psychology: identifying strengths and weaknesses in various schools of thought, defining and explaining psychological phenomena, evaluating the accuracy and usefulness of research studies, reducing logical flaws and personal biases, and improving the search for creative solutions. The Metathoughts are brought to life with practical examples, clinical vignettes, illustrations, anecdotes, thought-provoking exercises, useful antidotes, and contemporary social problems and issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ez7bNc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here to purchase on Amazon</a>.[/callout]</p>\n<p>[reminder]Which topic resonated with you?

It takes a chance meeting with a professor from student days &#8211; Jonah &#8211; to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mkRtv1\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to purchase on Amazon</a>.[/callout]</p>\n<p>[reminder]What are your thoughts about this episode?

She is a prolific <a href=\"http://www.jrothman.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\">author</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jrothman.com/blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">blogger</a> and also publishes a newsletter called <a href=\"http://www.jrothman.com/pragmaticmanager/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pragmatic Manager</a>. Johanna provides workshops, training, and other <a href=\"http://www.jrothman.com/services/\" target=\"_blank\">services</a> to organizations looking to improve the way they get work done.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/pragmatic-agile-estimation-predicting-the-unpredictable/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, I reviewed Johanna’s excellent book &#8211; <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WtdtzI\" target=\"_blank\">Predicting the Unpredictable</a> and still cannot recommend this important book on estimation enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Overall, this is an immensely practical book that belongs on the shelf of anyone working on an agile team. The practical suggestions on how to handle providing estimates is worth the prices of the book, making the coverage of advanced topics like #NoEstimates a welcome bonus. Highly recommended!</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>On this episode of Agile for Humans we talked about servant leadership at the program management level, metrics that matter and those that don’t, and where to focus your time and effort to effectively manage your project portfolio.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we wrapped up with thoughts on management, cost of delay concepts, and <strong>#NoEstimates</strong>.</p>\n<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Will you help the Agile for Humans podcast grow?

David starts the reader off with the current state of software development and why many of the problems that we observe and experience still persist today.</p>\n<p>He calls this “<strong>The Legacy Code Crisis</strong>” and does a brilliant job of making the case for agile software development practices.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Legacy code is code without confidence. @tobeagile</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Legacy+code+is+code+without+confidence.+%40tobeagile&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=https://ryanripley.com/beyond-legacy-code-with-david-bernstein-and-woody-zuill/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The second part of the book covers 9 practices that “extend the life and value of your software”.</p>\n<p>The 9 practices are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Say What, Why, and for Whom Before How</li>\n<li>Build in Small Batches</li>\n<li>Integrate Continuously</li>\n<li>Collaborate</li>\n<li>Create Clean Code</li>\n<li>Write the Test First</li>\n<li>Specify Behaviors with Tests</li>\n<li>Implement the Design Last</li>\n<li>Refactor Legacy Code</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each practice is explained clearly along with why each practice is important. The &#8220;why&#8221; is critical. It’s easy to explain the mechanics of TDD, but also showing the value that the practice provides makes the book appropriate for programmers, managers, and executives alike.</p>\n<p>My favorite aspect of this book is that David’s explanations and insights are <strong>infused with the values and principles of the agile manifesto. </strong></p>\n<p>His prose is engaging and feels conversational. It&#8217;s a pleasure to read David&#8217;s thoughts on these topics as he is clearly knowledgeable and passionate about agility and creating humane systems of work.</p>\n<p><strong>I love this book and cannot recommend it highly enough.</strong></p>\n<p>As Woody Zuill noted on the podcast: “<em>If I had what it takes to write a book, I would like to have written this book.</em>”</p>\n<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Will you help the Agile for Humans podcast grow?

After meeting Woody and speaking with Neil and Vasco, I don’t believe any of them suffer from self-loathing&#8230;</p>\n<p>Looking broader at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> community you’ll find people in roles ranging from developer, tester, analyst, manager, director, vice president, and even c-level executives who are all interested in exploring these and other agile ideas.</p>\n<h3>#NoEstimates advocates don’t want to do things they don’t like to do/are hard to do</h3>\n<p>The question here is not about difficulty or desire. Value is at the center of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> discussion. As seen in the Nordstrom video,<a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/agile-software-delivery-with-noestimates/\" target=\"_blank\"> a small team was able to deliver value back to customers without estimates</a>.</p>\n<p>Can such an approach work on larger projects and still give the business the information they need to plan? <strong>Certainly.</strong></p>\n<p>What does that look like across multiple contexts and domains?<strong> That is what people are still exploring and testing.</strong></p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> and Agile are not silver bullets. <strong>These ideas are not one size fit all.</strong> These are ideas built on transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Inherently, you have to adjust for your domain and context.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, Agile is not a good fit for what you are trying to do.</p>\n<h3>#NoEstimates advocates avoid commitment, fear blame, and loath accountability</h3>\n<p>This is just a character attack that is unfounded and offensive. Agile and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> advocates support transparency, are open to inspection, and are skilled at adaptation.</p>\n<p><strong>We embrace uncertainty and cope with the unknown by making small decisions frequently.</strong></p>\n<p>Working like this means we embrace the commitments we make to our customers, take responsibility for our work, and are accountable to our teammates to bring the best of our abilities to bear each day. We inspect these commitments frequently and make adjustments as we learn new things about the product we are building.</p>\n<p><strong>Perhaps the reaction from developers and team members that some have observed is a disdain for coercion.</strong></p>\n<p>When someone with authority addresses the team and says, “<em>I promised those features for next Wednesday. How long will it take you to get them done by next Wednesday?</em>” people get annoyed.</p>\n<p>Equally damaging is taking an estimate and turning it in to a deadline. To add insult to injury, these same people shame the team for missing a date they never committed to in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Coercion is a damaging practice that is often mistaken as “avoiding commitment”, “fearing blame”, and “loathing accountability”.</strong></p>\n<p>But that’s not the fault of estimates, as they say. Bad management is to blame!</p>\n<h3>#NoEstimates does not fix bad management</h3>\n<p><strong>Sure it can.</strong> Agility and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> make the work and the systems that impact the work transparent. Transparency is the bane of control minded management (“bad management”). It threatens power structures and the rewards that come with such things.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> <a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/noestimates-embraces-customer-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\">Embracing Customer Collaboration</a>, transparency is magnified.</p>\n<p>Clearly Agile and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> concepts have the best chance of chipping away at the command-and-control mindset of traditional management (“bad management”).</p>\n<p>It’s isn’t shocking that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> critics are not happy with the advocates. Look what critics stand to lose.</p>\n<h3>#NoEstimates arguments appeal to the disgruntled, naive, gullible, and inexperienced</h3>\n<p><strong>Ad Hominem much?</strong> Another baseless attack. Agile minded developers, managers, and executives are motivated, intelligent, and experienced individuals. Along with a wide range of roles, the Agile community has a wide range of skillsets and experiences.</p>\n<h3>#NoEstimates advocates avoid exchanges with critics</h3>\n<p><strong>Hardly the case:</strong> The 3 main advocates have gone 100’s of tweets deep with many critics and those who ask questions about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> concepts. Each of them are also very generous with their time and participate in 1:1 sessions over Skype, record podcasts, sit down for interviews, and engage in the community through participation at agile conferences.</p>\n<p>Are there a few individuals who typically find themselves on the “blocked” list of agilists? <strong>Yes.</strong></p>\n<p>However, honest inquiry is almost always answered with thoughtful responses and generous donations of time and energy to help others understand these advanced agile concepts.</p>\n<p>Here are podcasts with all 3 of the main <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> advocates sharing their ideas and opening themselves up to questioning, scrutiny, and criticism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Woody Zuill &#8211; </strong><a href=\"http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill\" target=\"_blank\">http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/012-agile-for-humans/\" target=\"_blank\">Woody Zuill on Agile for Humans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thisagilelife.com/76/\" target=\"_blank\">Woody Zuill on This Agile Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tcagley.wordpress.com/2015/06/28/spamcast-348-woody-zuill-noestimates/\" target=\"_blank\">Woody Zuill on SPaMCAST</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Neil Killick &#8211; </strong><a href=\"http://neilkillick.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://neilkillick.com</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/005-agile-for-humans/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Killick on Agile for Humans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thisagilelife.com/58/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Killick on This Agile Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theagilerevolution.com/2013/07/14/episode-59-noestimates-with-neil-killick/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Killick on The Agile Revolution</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Vasco Duarte &#8211; </strong><a href=\"http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.com</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ryanripley.com/noestimates-with-vasco-duarte/\" target=\"_blank\">Vasco Duarte on Agile for Humans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tcagley.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/spamcast-372-vasco-duarte-noestimates/\" target=\"_blank\">Vasco Duarte on SPaMCAST</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.scrum-master-toolbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vasco&#8217;s Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve yet to see a critic do the same&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ryanripley.com/more-strawmen-for-the-noestimates-fire/\">More Strawmen for the #NoEstimates Fire</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ryanripley.com\">Ryan Ripley</a>.</p>\n",

Once the stories were <strong>prioritized</strong>, they got to <strong>work</strong>.</p>\n<p>By the end of the 1 week experiment, the team delivered an application that <strong>met the needs of their customers</strong>. And they did all of this <strong>without estimates</strong>.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/szr0ezLyQHY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So how did Nordstom&#8217;s Innovation Lab get a product shipped in 1 week without using estimates?</p>\n<p>Here are a few key points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Timeboxing:</strong>  By limiting their time to a week, the team had to slice stories down to a size that made sense within their timebox. This kept the work small and the stories focused. In other words, the timebox helped create a natural heuristic for breaking down work. This short timeline also helped to naturally limit the teams Work in Process (WIP).</li>\n<li><strong>Located the Team in the Store:</strong>  By putting the flash mob dev team in the middle of a store, the customer was always front and center in the process. The customers could at any time see what the team was working on and could provide much valued guidance and feedback as needed. This made sure that the team was &#8220;never working on anything not valued by the customer&#8221;.</li>\n<li><strong>Utilized a User Story Map:</strong>  The user story map kept the big picture in mind and also made the work visible. By breaking down capabilities in to features and features in to stories, the customer could then prioritize the stories and make sure that the most important items made it in to the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Paper Prototyping:</strong>  Cheap and quick feedback reduced waste and significantly lowered the cost of change. UX/UI ideas were quickly validated and refined by the customer in real-time (thanks to colocation) and only after the customer agreed was any code written. The design was emergent.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Feedback Loops:</strong>  The customer was involved in every decision and saw progress regularly. Trust was high between the dev team and customers thanks to these short feedback loops. This happened because the work was transparent and progress was obvious.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>The majority of the agile manifesto shines through in those 5 points. It&#8217;s a great story of a simple project that embraced agility and delivered.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>But this video raised a lot of questions and criticisms. While I can&#8217;t cover all of them in this post, there were a few that I found interesting that I&#8217;ll share some thoughts on:</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What about forecasting Estimates at Completion (EAC)? You can&#8217;t do that with #NoEstimates!</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>What this is asking for is the forecasted cost at completion. And I think we can get there with the way that the Nordstrom Innovation Lab does their work.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The cost is fixed.</strong> Let&#8217;s pretend that it costs <strong>$10,000 per week</strong> to fund the team.</li>\n<li>Let&#8217;s also pretend that the <strong>team finishes 10 stories per week.</strong></li>\n<li>Since the team created a story map (such a great tool &#8211; <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Q9Spfc\" target=\"_blank\">read Jeff Patton&#8217;s book</a> to learn more) we can <strong>forecast how many weeks (sprints) it will take to complete all of the needed capabilities</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiply that number by $10,000</strong> (weekly burn rate) and you can provide an EAC.</li>\n<li>Is it perfect? <strong>Nope.</strong> Is it exact? <strong>Nope.</strong> Will it change? <strong>Yep.</strong> But it is likely accurate enough for some contexts.</li>\n<li>And<strong> it gets more accurate as the project progresses.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>But this is a simple project, what are the parameters for a &#8220;real&#8221; project? Can&#8217;t just claim 1 and done!</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>That&#8217;s moving the goal post down the field. You should be careful when doing that, they weight over 1,100 lbs. Make sure you life with your knees. The question posed was &#8220;How can you make decisions &#8211; in the presence of uncertainty &#8211; without estimates?&#8221; Nordstrom answered it with their video. They made lots of decisions with a burn rate, a story map, and a timebox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Can this apply to larger projects?</strong> Possibly. What I outlined above could be a way to go. I&#8217;ve worked that way with in-house IT teams and did well with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Can it work for consulting firms or work for hire?</strong> No idea. I&#8217;ve never been a consultant.</li>\n<li><strong>What about domains with regulation XYZ?</strong> No idea. I&#8217;ve never been subject to regulation XYZ and I&#8217;ve probably never worked in your domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Would you deploy ERP this way?</strong> Nope! I&#8217;m not sure that agile is the right approach for highly coupled massive initiatives like ERP deployments. YMMV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least is one of my favorite questions:  <strong>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the team making implicit estimates by slicing work in relation to a 1 week timebox?&#8221;</strong>  Sure. Feel free to claim the win with the &#8220;<strong>everything is an estimate</strong>&#8221; argument.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT in the scenario I laid out, the estimate/forecast is a by-product of the work being done.</strong></p>\n<p>This subtle difference is critical to teams successfully delivering software with agile practices.</p>\n<p>[reminder]I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on the video.

Any IT manager, director, or VP should take that point to heart.</p>\n<p>[featured-image single_newwindow=&#8221;false&#8221;]We need to set this strawman argument ablaze once and for all to move the #NoEstimates conversation forward.[/featured-image]</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene</a> lost me when he connected this concept to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Meeting the needs of my clients is my objection to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a>. Clients may have questions that require estimates to answer. In “<a href=\"https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2015/07/13/estimates-uses-abuses-and-that-credibility-thing-again/\" target=\"_blank\">Estimates – Uses, Abuses, and that Credibility Thing Again</a>”, I listed several that were taken from a post by a prominent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> advocate [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill\" target=\"_blank\">Woody Zuill</a>]. In my opinion, those questions become my concern by virtue of being my client’s concern. Suggesting, as that advocate does, that they need different questions, is not serving their needs.”  <strong>&#8211;from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Hughson</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/the-business-of-it-customers-clients-and-fit-for-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\">Form Follows Function Blog</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene</a> is arguing that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> does not address the needs of clients. He took this argument a step further in his conclusion by asserting that client’s needs are largely ignored in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> environment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“While it is certainly possible to deliver IT in an environment where the clients’ needs are largely ignored, doing so is detrimental to the clients, to the providers, and to the organization(s) to which they belong.”  <strong>&#8211;from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Hughson</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/the-business-of-it-customers-clients-and-fit-for-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\">Form Follows Function Blog</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>We need to set this <a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis. com/strawman\" target=\"_blank\">strawman argument</a> ablaze once and for all to move the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> conversation forward.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> is an agile idea that is informed and guided by the <a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org\" target=\"_blank\">Agile Manifesto</a>.</p>\n<p>The Manifesto clearly defines the working relationship between agile teams and their business partners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First as a value statement:  <strong>Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation</strong></li>\n<li>Second as a principle:  <strong>Business People and Developers Must Work Together Daily Throughout the Project</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What this means is that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> practices cannot be applied to a project without the consent of the business people who are working together daily with the development team.  If the customer believes that an estimate is needed to make a decision about the work the team is doing, then deliver an estimate!</p>\n<p>Woody Zuill – the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> advocate that Gene referred to in his post – also <a href=\"http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/ 2013/05/13/my-customers-need- estimates-what-do-i-do/\" target=\"_blank\">advocates this stance</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“How Can I Get These Customers Without Estimates?  This is a very easy question to answer: You probably can’t get these customers without estimates.  They want estimates – it’s part of the way they think. You probably <strong>MUST DO ESTIMATES</strong> for these customers. <strong> That is, you don’t tell these customers “We don’t do estimates” if you want to work with them.</strong>” [<em>emphasis is mine &#8211;RR</em>]  <strong>&#8212; from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill\" target=\"_blank\">Woody Zuill</a> – <a href=\"http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/\" target=\"_blank\">Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Agility</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Agilists do not leave their customers behind, nor do we ignore the needs of our clients.</p>\n<p><strong>In fact, the Agile Manifesto and the Scrum Guide both put the customer squarely in the driver’s seat and makes delivering valuable software frequently to our clients and customers our highest priority.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Agile Manifesto &amp; Scrum Guide put the customer in the drivers seat.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=The+Agile+Manifesto+%26amp%3B+Scrum+Guide+put+the+customer+in+the+drivers+seat.&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=https://ryanripley.com/noestimates-embraces-customer-collaboration/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a> – being an agile concept – also embraces the values and principles of the manifesto and scrum guide. We are simply asking our clients and customers questions about the way <strong>we</strong> – as a <strong>team</strong> – do <strong>our</strong> work.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things that we ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does the overhead of some types of estimation make sense given what we already know?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can a slicing heuristic (1 acceptance test per story) reduce the cost of estimation?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Does a forecast enable predictable delivery? If so, can we count stories instead of estimating tasks?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can a story map keep the team aligned and aware of the big picture?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What decision are you trying to make and is an estimate the right tool?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene</a> is right to worry that being a bad partner will impact credibility, trust, and the overall relationship with our clients and customers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We shouldn’t be surprised when things that don’t promote the client’s welfare (or, at least, aren’t presented in that manner) are met with a lack of interest. We definitely shouldn’t be surprised when things that are seen as a net negative to the customer are met with hostility. Understanding and respecting the client’s point of view is required to avoid damaging our credibility and relationship with them.”  <strong>&#8211;from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneHughson\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Hughson</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/the-business-of-it-customers-clients-and-fit-for-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\">Form Follows Function Blog</a></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>In the case of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/noestimates\" target=\"_blank\">#NoEstimates</a>, however, the customer/client is in the driver seat. Part of the commitment to agile is to reflect how we can be more effective, then tune and adjust our behaviors.</p>\n<p>We go through this process when making many decisions as an agile team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Should we accept the higher upfront cost of adopting test driven development?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can we afford to implement a continuous integration server?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Should we work in 2, 3, or 4 week sprints? Which interval gives the business the best opportunity to make a decision?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list goes on and on. <strong>Estimates are no different.</strong> If it turns out that estimates are needed to satisfy the needs of the customer, then we provide estimates.</p>\n<p>If not, <strong>we</strong> continue to seek better ways to do <strong>our</strong> work <strong>together</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ryanripley.com/noestimates-embraces-customer-collaboration/\">#NoEstimates Embraces Customer Collaboration</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ryanripley.com\">Ryan Ripley</a>.</p>\n",

We started with a discussion about scaling agile, the limitations of frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and DaD.</p>\n<p>We then moved on to the limits that consistency puts on innovation and how tuning consistency can be a serious competitive advantage. However, this is complicated task because “<strong>anytime we are going for consistency we are necessarily hurting innovation in that same space.</strong>”</p>\n<p>Next we discussed the controversial topic of refactoring vs test driven development (TDD). Arlo described his views on the differences between the two skills and ways that teams can work to refactor their designs safely &#8211; with tools &#8211; so that the code can then be come testable using TDD practices.</p>\n<p>On the TDD side of the discussion the group agreed that “<strong>a unit test that uses mocks is not a unit test.</strong>” Mocks are a smell that can reveal design issues within your code. Arlo also provided ideas about how to work without mocks and improve designs.</p>\n<p>Finally, we covered hiring people for emotional intelligence instead of skills. If smart, inquisitive people can be taught programming and other related skills quickly (~6 months) then what advantage does hiring for skills really bring to a team? <strong>Couldn’t it be better to hire for empathy and culture first if skill are cheap to grow…especially in a pair/mob-programming environments?</strong></p>\n<p>The answers to these questions and how this mindset shifts hiring led to an interesting conversation about how such thinking can help companies build innovative and effective teams.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Empathy and Emotional Intelligence are skills worth hiring for.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Empathy+and+Emotional+Intelligence+are+skills+worth+hiring+for.&#038;via=ryanripley&#038;related=ryanripley&#038;url=https://ryanripley.com/afh-016-are-you-mocking-my-unit-tests-podcast/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>\n<p><em>Agile for Humans is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.audibletrial.com/agile\" target=\"_blank\">audible.com</a> – get one FREE audiobook download and 30 day free trial at <a href=\"http://www.audibletrial.com/agile\" target=\"_blank\">www.audibletrial.com/agile</a></em></p>\n<h2>Resources, Plugs, and More</h2>\n<p><strong>Ryan</strong> &#8211; <a href=\"https://ryanripley.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://ryanripley.com</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No plugs from me this week.

Zach Bonaker (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZachBonaker\" target=\"_blank\">@zachbonaker</a>) got lost in an English bog, Amitai Schlair (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/schmonz\" target=\"_blank\">@schmonz</a>) was wandering in Guatemala and Ryan Ripley (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanripley\" target=\"_blank\">@ryanripley</a>) was nearly sucked in to the power fueled DC world, but the three managed to come together to ponder some questions about coaching agile teams.</p>\n<h3>WHEN DOES AN AGILE TEAM NEED COACHING?</h3>\n<p>We started with defining coaching, then mentoring, and finally consulting. And ultimately came upon an important insight. If the team knows how to learn together and has a high level of skill in conducting retrospectives, they likely need little coaching. However, such stars rarely align. We discussed if the team should choose when a coach is needed, and managements role in the process. We then moved on to our next question:</p>\n<h3>WHEN SHOULD AN AGILE COACH LEAVE?</h3>\n<p>When the checks start to bounce, of course! This is another difficult situation to handle. It takes a great amount of awareness to realize that the team can find success without you (the coach). Watching the teams behaviors, the systems they are working within, and the response they have to the coach are all important considerations. On the other hand, we did discuss that in professional sports, the coach never leaves. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=22&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CJEBEBYwFWoVChMIld2WgP_HxwIVip-ACh15wAGe&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2502577-lebron-james-is-officially-nbas-hardest-player-to-coach&amp;ei=2lfeVZWIDoq_ggT5gIfwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqQ-cYEKeaYAuSQSLfi_CAdhhpEA&amp;sig2=HA1p6yTh7wsV86utxi0-UQ\" target=\"_blank\">Even LeBron James has a coach</a>.</p>\n<p>The conversation then pivoted in to agile transformations. At the heart our discussion was the idea of <a href=\"http://agileanswerman.com/encourage-your-scrum-team-during-an-agile-transformation/\" target=\"_blank\">influence vs coercion</a> and how coercion can tank an agile transformation quickly. The tendency to hold on the old practices, even harmful ones, is hard to break as teams new to agile often struggle to embrace self-organization. Trust was also a key theme throughout.</p>\n<p>Amitai was kind enough to share <a href=\"https://agilein3minut.es/8/\" target=\"_blank\">episode 8 (care)</a> of his podcast: <a href=\"https://agilein3minut.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Agile in 3 Minutes</a>. He creates art each week by focusing on one agile idea each week. Insightful and poetic, Agile in 3 Minutes is clearly a labor of love that I’m grateful to enjoy each week. I hope you give Agile in 3 Minutes a listen and <a href=\"https://agilein3minut.es/archive/index.rss\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe via rss here</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Zach told us about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agilecoffee\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Bonacci’s</a> recent <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/770793397/agile-coaching-cards\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter project: Agile Coaching Cards</a>. Vic was a <a href=\"http://agileanswerman.com/011-agile-for-humans/\" target=\"_blank\">recent guest on Agile for Humans</a> and taught us how to play <a href=\"http://leancoffee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lean Coffee</a>. He’s now selling a deck of cards on Kickstarter designed to help teams get up to speed quickly with Lean Coffee discussion. This is a fun tool that can help teams facilitate conversations about agile topics.</p>\n<p>And then…we called it a night.</p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to continue the conversation, please visit <a href=\"http://agileanswerman.com/ask-a-question/\">www.agileanswerman.com/ask-a-question</a>. You can record a message that could end up on the show or send us an email with your feedback, topics, and questions.
